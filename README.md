# Redbus-Data-Scraping-With-Selenium-And-Dynamic-Filtering-Using-Streamlit

This project scrapes real-time bus data from the Redbus website for various routes across 10 different states using Selenium. The scraped data, including bus availability, timings, prices, and operators, is stored in a SQL database. An interactive Streamlit application is used to present the data, enabling users to explore bus options for different routes and filter based on their preferences.

Features:

Scrapes live bus data from Redbus using Selenium.
Stores data in a SQL database for easy access and querying.
Interactive Streamlit dashboard for exploring bus data.
Filtering options for route, state, price, and bus operator.

Technologies Used:

* Selenium for web scraping
* SQL for database storage
* Streamlit for interactive UI
